My Snake Game

This is my version of the classic Snake Game developed with Turtle Module using Pyhton. If you own a Nokia years ago, for sure you remember this classic game.

This is part of the Udemy Course 100 Days of Code: The complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

I made my own improvements to the game. I solved the problem when the snake goes back on itself when you change the direction really fast. In addition, I didn't like how the food appear in the middle of two possible ways and it looks a little bit hard to hit it. 

I also added a first question to the user in order to set up the speed of the game.

Some other improvement was to add a new loop that allows the user to play again, an save the highest score just like real video games. 

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did't
